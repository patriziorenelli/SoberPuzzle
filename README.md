# Sober Puzzle - Multimodal Version

The repository contains the implementation of an Android mobile application that allows you to assess a subject's psychophysical state.
The project is based on psychophysical tests conducted through various minigames. Each minigame is designed to test various metrics such as concentration, reactivity, and short-term memory.

The project uses various types of interaction other than the classic point-and-click, exploiting vibration, sound, visual, pressure and others.

The project was developed as part of the "Multimodal Interaction" course during the Master's degree in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome in the 2024/25 academic year.
